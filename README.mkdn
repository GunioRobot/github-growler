This is Github Growler: fetches GitHub timeline and growls as new activies are coming in.

This is a perl script that runs as a daemon. You need to install CPAN module dependencies by running `cpan -i`.  See `man cpan` for details.

You need to set `github.user` and `github.token1 in your [global git config](http://github.com/guides/local-github-config) or pass them to the command line arguments.

By default this scripts fetches the github updates every 300 seconds and displays at most 10 Growl notification per fetch and you can change the both settings with Mac OS X preferences:

    defaults write net.bulknews.GitHubGrowler interval 180
    defaults write net.bulknews.GitHubGrowler maxGrowls 5

It's in my TODO to make it a standalone app. I guess we could use [Platypus](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus) and bundle all CPAN dependencies in its Resources folder by removing the non pure-perl module dependency (i.e. XML::LibXML).
